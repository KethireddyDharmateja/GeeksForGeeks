# Number of substrings of one string present in other
# Last Updated : 07 Oct, 2022
# Suppose we are given a string s1, we need to the find total number of substring(including multiple occurrences of the same substring) of s1 which are present in string s2. 

# Examples: 

# Input : s1 = aab
#         s2 = aaaab
# Output :6
# Substrings of s1 are ["a", "a", "b", "aa", 
# "ab", "aab"]. These all are present in s2. 
# Hence, answer is 6.

# Input :s1 = abcd
#       s2 = swalencud
# Output :3 

def countsubstrings(s1, s2):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s1)):
        s3 = ""
        for j in range(i, len(s1)):
            s3 = s3+s1[j]
            # print(s3)
            if s2.find(s3) != -1:
                count = count+1
    return count

if __name__ == "__main__" :
    s1 = "abcd"
    s2 = "swalencud"
    
    print(countsubstrings(s1,s2))
